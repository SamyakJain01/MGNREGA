              <p>explain this in simple terms  - MGNREGA has been considered one of the biggest social welfare programs in the world. In its first 10 years, the total expenditure on this program was 3.14 lakh crore rupees and it generated work of 1980 crore person-days 1. The program has lifted many people out of poverty, though there are still some issues that need to be addressed 1. Studies have shown that wages earned under MGNREGA helped compensate for income loss during the lockdown, with demand for work under MGNREGA spiking to record-high levels during the pandemic years 2. Overall, MGNREGA has had a significant impact on rural employment and poverty reduction in India.</p>

              <p>MGNREGA is a program that started in 2005 to help people in rural areas of India find work. The government promised to give people at least 100 days of work each year. The idea for this program was first introduced in 1991 by the Prime Minister at the time, P.V. Narasimha Rao. In 2004, before the elections, people wanted a program that would give them food in exchange for work. Manmohan Singh and Jairam Ramesh, who were writing the Congress party’s plan for the elections, liked this idea. After the Congress party won the elections, they made this idea one of their top priorities. The program was first called the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in 2005, but its name was changed to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in 2009.</p>
